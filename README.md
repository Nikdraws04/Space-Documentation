# Image Commands
Image commands are a fun way to mess with friends or just to generate a bunch of funny pictures. Every picture command except for `s!tweet` works the same just type the command you want. 
```wanted
skydiving
rip
hacker
dj
bobross
bodybuilder
jogger
ugly
long/superlong
thick/superthick
stonks
```
And then @ the person you want example: `s!stonks @Nikdraws`.

## Tweet (beta)
`s!tweet <user> <text>`
The tweet command generates a fake twitter screenshot and works a bit different then the other image commands. Just type `s!tweet` then the user and then what the user says example: `s!tweet @Nikdraws Hello World!`. Disclaimer: Please keep in mind that this command is pretty complicated to programm and still has a lot of problems.
