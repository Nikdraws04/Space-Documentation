# Space-Documentation
Official Documentation for the Discord bot Space

Welcome to the Official Space Documentation!

You can find here descriptions for all commands you can access these trough the different branches.

Space is now over 6months in developement and has reached the limit of 100 servers. Sadly i can't verify him at the moment to get him in more server but i will verify him asap.
If you have any issues please use the command `s!report` or just write it in the issues tab and i will try to fix it asap. You can join the support server [here](https://discord.gg/yaMgKGDYV7)
