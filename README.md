# Reddit Commands

Reddit commands takes the current top posts from a subreddit and posts them directly into discord. Reddit commands work all the same just pick one reddit command you want and it gives you a picture from this topic example: `s!dog` gives you a dog picture or `s!onejob` gives you a picture from someone who messed up his job.

## List
```
cat
dog
comic
minecraft
meme
onejob
art
facepalm
furry
lego
```
## Issues
There is a bug that discord doesn't load some pictures but this is an error from discord and not from the bot. Since the bot takes the Top 100 posts from the subreddit it can happen that the bot gives you the same image 2 or 3 times in a row.
